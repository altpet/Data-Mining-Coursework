# Data-Mining-Coursework

This was my submission for my Data Mining coursework in my fourth year of my MEng in Discrete Mathematics

The objective of the assignment was to train models that could predict cellular composition and count the contents of cells using provided training data.

An emphasis of the coursework was the large scale of the training data, requiring you to improvise and have to find intelligent workarounds to train a model during the limited timeframe for training.

The final submission is quite long, as we were required to show full results for a required number of training epochs, as well as showing data/results that informed our later decision making processes.
